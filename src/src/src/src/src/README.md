# Banking System – Homework 1 (Modelling)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Banking System** model developed as part of *Homework 1 (Modelling)* in the course **Object-Oriented Analysis and Development**.  

The system demonstrates key **OOP principles** (abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, overriding, overloading, and interfaces) in a real-world banking scenario. Customers can open accounts, deposit and withdraw funds (with restrictions), and receive interest on eligible accounts.
